To run this application locally, you will need to set up some environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akashprap/Flask_Blog
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
     virtualenv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

  
5. Set up the following environment variables:

   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for your application.
   - `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: The URI for your database (SQLite).
   - `EMAIL_USER`: Your email address for sending emails.
   - `EMAIL_PASS`: Your email password or an app-specific password for sending emails.


    - Open a terminal or Command Prompt window.

   - Set the `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` environment variables using the following commands:

     - For Windows:

       ```batch
       setx EMAIL_USER "your_email@gmail.com"
       setx EMAIL_PASS "your_email_password_or_app_password"
       ```

       ```bash
       export EMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
       export EMAIL_PASS="your_email_password_or_app_password"
       ```

   Replace `"your_email@gmail.com"` with your email address and `"your_email_password_or_app_password"` with your email password or an app-specific password if applicable.

   You can set these environment variables in your system or by using a tool like `python-dotenv`.
